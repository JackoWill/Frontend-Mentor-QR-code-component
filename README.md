## Overview

I built this simple QR component using flexbox and grid, applying the knowledge I have learnt from the past week from learning basic HTML & CSS. I had a lot of fun building this and cant wait to learn more and build more projects!

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned by using grid I could center the whole card on the page and also setting the image to max-width: 100% would shrink it to fit the container.

### Continued development

I would like to get better using Flexbox and CSS Grid and when to use them and why.
